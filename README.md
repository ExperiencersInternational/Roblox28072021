# Roblox28072021
A copy of a version of Roblox released on 28/07/2021 and copies of HTTP requests that VirusTotal detects the installer executable makes.

In order for this to work, I'd recommend trying to use XAMPP to create a server on 127.0.0.1:80 and modifying C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts using Notepad (as an admin) to redirect traffic that is heading for http://clientsettingscdn.roblox.com/ and setup.rbxcdn.com to ::1 in hosts. I recommend reading a tutorial on how to use hosts so it runs correctly.
